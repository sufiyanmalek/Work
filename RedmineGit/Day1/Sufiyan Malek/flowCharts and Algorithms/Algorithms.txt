//// algorithm to print area of circle


step 1: get input of radius of circle and store in r,
step 2: declare a variable area,
step 3: area = 3.14 * r * r,
step 4: Return the value of area.


// sum of all the even numbers

step 1: get in n and i=0 and initiate variable sum(n is number that we want to do loop),
step 2: Run while loop on condition i <= n,
step 3: and check if i%2==0 then do addition of that i with sum,
step 4: return the value of sum after the while loop.
